#eCommerce

A very simple full stack eCommerce app where a user can view products and buy them. A user's details can be changed. Products also have a showcase page where the user can view the details of the product. A user can also post reviews of the product, which can be seen by other users on the website. 

Users can view products by brands as well. All products of individual brands are listed on a page.

Stats for the last year can be viewed on a monthly basis. So we can see the sales we made during the last year and see the sales by month, for example the sales in the month of May.

The front end uses React while the backend uses Express and Mongoose as it's database.
Used Aggregation Pipelines to get some of the data required.
